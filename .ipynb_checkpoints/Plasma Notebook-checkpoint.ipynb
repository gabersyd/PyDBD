    "<p style=\"text-align:justify\"> Plasma, also known as the fourth state of matter is the state of matter which consists of ionized particles(ions/electrons) and neutrals. The electric and magnetic force are dominant in the plasma and they play an important role in the its physics. There are different ways of plasma generation that include heating or applying high electric field. Under normal condition plasma do not exist freely on nature as the charged particles try to recombine and form netural particles. Here we discuss about the numerical simulation of special type of plasma known as Dielectrci Barrier Discharge (DBD) that has a lot of industrial importances.</p>"

    "### 1. Introduction to Dielectric Barrier Discharge\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align:justify\"> \n",
    "Dielectric Barrier Discharge (DBD) also known as silent discharge is a type of electrical discharge in which at least one of the electrodes is shielded with a dielectric layer. Dielectric which is insulator in nature doesn't allow the flow of charged particles between the electrodes as a result the flux of charged particles towards the dielectric surface causes them to get diposited there. \n",
    "Dielectric Barrier Discharge is a good example of non-thermal plasma. In DBD the ion temperature is very low (close or equal to room temperature) while the electron temperature is very high. This property is regarded as a very important property for industrial use because it enables us to use the plasma for material treatment. The low ion temperature prevents the material from getting melted or burnt (bulk properties) while the high electron temperature helps in changing the properties of the surface being treated.  </p>"

    "### 4. Basic Equations\n",
    "The numerical modeling of the physical phenomenon in our DBD reactor has been done by solving\n",
    "the corresponding mathematical equations using appropriate numerical methods. The mathematical\n",
    "equations in this model include the continuity equation that is coupled coupled with Poisson equa-\n",
    "tion along with the equation of charge accumulation on the surface of dielectric. As the reactor is\n",
    "symmetric in axial direction the modeling is done in one dimension only. The differential equations\n",
    "used on this numerical model are discussed below.\n",
    "#### Continuity Equation\n",
    "The continuity equation used in this model is based on the conservation of charge and other neutral\n",
    "species inside the plasma reactor. Particles inside the plasma reactor are either advected or diffused\n",
    "or generated/destroyed by corresponding chemical reactions. The general form of continuity equation\n",
    "used in this model is,\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\frac{dn}{ dt}+ \\nabla  \\Gamma = S\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "where $\\Gamma$ is the flux of particles given by,\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\Gamma \t=(Z nv-D \\nabla n )\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\t\n",
    "The first term Znv is the advection component that gives the drift of charged particles \tin the direction of electric field. The positive ions in the plasma move towards the electric field while the electrons and negative ion move away from it. The neutral species(that includes the excited molecules) show no response to the direction of electric field. The $D\\nabla n$ is the diffusion term that gives the flow of particles due the concentration gradient. The particles move from the region of higher concentration to the region of low concentration until there is no concentration gradient. Here n is the number density of plasma species (electron, ion or excited molecules) with charge Z ($\\pm$for electrons/ions), v is the velocity of particles which can be calculated by multiplying the mobility of the charged particle with the electric field. D is the diffusion coefficient of the particles that gives the rate at which the particles are diffused in proportion to the concentration gradient. S is the source/sink term which corresponds to the rate at which a particle is formed or destroyed according to the corresponding chemical reaction. The source/sink term is given by the formula $S=m_ik_in_in_j$,  where m is the mole fraction of the particle being generated, $k_i$ is the corresponding reaction rate of the particle\twith number density ni when it collides with the target particle with number density $n_j$ (neutral molecules). The value of mobility, diffusion and reaction rate are the function of electric field. In this simulation the value of these parameters are obtained from a software named BOLSIG+ [ref..] that solves Boltzmann equation for electrons in weakly ionized gas to calculate the electron transport coefficients and collision rate coefficients which can be used in the fluid models.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Poisson's Equation\n",
    "The motion of charge inside the plasma reactor causes the variation of charge at various regions between the\n",
    "electrodes which in return causes the variation in electric field inside the reactor. The value of electrostatic\n",
    "potential at various region between the electrodes can be calculated by solving the Poisson equation. Since the\n",
    "transport parameters like mobility and diffusion and the source/sink term used in the continuity equation is the\n",
    "function of electric field, and the electric field can be calculated as the negative gradient of electric potential, the\n",
    "Poisson equation has to be solved each time before solving the continuity equation in the simulation. The\n",
    "Poisson equation can be expressed as:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\nabla ^2 V=\\frac{\\rho}{\\epsilon}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "where V is the electrostatic potential, $\\rho$ is the charge density which is given by the product of charge of an\n",
    "electron with the net charge in the grid point inside the plasma reactor and $\\epsilon$ is the permittivity of medium.\n",

    "#### Equation of Charge Accumulation on Surface of Dielectric\n",
    "As both the electrodes in this research are covered with dielectric, which is an insulator and cannot conduct the charged particles\n",
    "to the electrodes, the flux of electric charges towards the dielectric causes the deposition of charged particles on\n",
    "the dielectric surface. This is regarded as the important property of DBD because the charge accumulation helps\n",
    "in limiting the value of current between the electrodes and makes the discharge more uniform.\n",
    "The equation of charge accumulation on the surface of dielectric is represented by the following equations.\n",

    "### 5. Numerical Simulation\n",
    "In this modelling all the differential equations are solved using finite difference method. As a first approach all the differential equations are written in finite difference form and the program is executed. The program however becomes unstable and therefore adaptive time stepping is used using Von Neumann Stability analysis. The program becomes stable for quite a long time and finally becomes unstable. The adaptive time stepping makes the simulation very slow as well. Finally implicit solver is used which gives stable solution for a quite long time stepping as well making the simulation very fast as compared to other methods."
