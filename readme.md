PyDBD is a 1D python code developed to generate results that are reported in this publication: https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2058-6272/ac241f

Besides DBD simulation the code is also capable of modeling microplasma. The examples of microplasma are also included in this repository. 


To run the code, 
* clone the repository
* install python with all necessary libraries (numpy, scipy, matplotlib)
* browse cd to the case directory 
* run the python script using : python parallelFCT.py

The code will generate plots and save results in output folder. 
There are several examples in this repository for various conditions. 
The conditions can be changed by editing the conditions.txt file. There will be conditions.txt file in each case folder

Following are the plots generated by an example case folder. The conditions are 250 mTorr case with 2.5 cm gap between the electrodes.
The applied voltage is 50V 13.56 MHz.
